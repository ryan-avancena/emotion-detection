# Emotion Detection with Multinomial Naive Bayes and Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM)
 
The goal of this project is to build an AI model that can accurately classify text based on emotion.
I'm using a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parulpandey/emotion-dataset/data) of over 10,000 labeled personal tweets to train my model.

Some key insights I want to explore include:
* What are the common words used across different sentiments?
* The differences between using a probabilistic model like Naive Bayes vs. using an RNN.

For fun, I included a radar chart to display the probabilities in a visual format.
